# DOKKAEBI 👺

**Algorithmic Trading Platform Powered by HebbNet**

> *"A goblin that learns from the markets using biological neural networks"*

## 🔥 Project Overview

DOKKAEBI is an algorithmic trading platform that uses Hebbian learning principles (HebbNet) instead of traditional backpropagation. Inspired by biological neural networks, it learns market patterns through spike-timing-dependent plasticity and local learning rules.

## 🧠 Core Technology

- **HebbNet**: Biologically-inspired neural networks
- **No Backpropagation**: Local learning rules only
- **Real-time Learning**: Adapts to market conditions without retraining
- **Memory Bank**: Persistent knowledge management system

## 🚀 The Elite Crew

- **HEX** 🦄: System architecture & integration
- **VIPER** 🐍: Lightning-fast Python trading engine
- **DIESEL** 🔥: Market data pipeline architecture
- **REPO** 🎨: Trading dashboard & visualizations
- **SYNAPSE** 🧠: HebbNet algorithm implementation

## ⚠️ SACRED RULE

**NEVER ABANDON HEBBNET**: Every prediction, every signal, every trading decision MUST use HebbNet. No reverting to moving averages, RSI, or traditional indicators without explicit approval.

## 🎯 Mission

Build a trading platform that:
1. Uses ONLY biological learning principles
2. Adapts in real-time to market dynamics
3. Maintains persistent memory of successful strategies
4. Generates consistent alpha through unique insights
