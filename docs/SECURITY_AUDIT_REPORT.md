# ðŸš¨ SECURITY AUDIT REPORT - EXPOSED SECRETS
**Date:** August 13, 2025  
**Auditor:** Hex  
**Status:** RESOLVED - Keys Removed from Codebase  
**Update:** All exposed keys have been scrubbed from the repository

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
GitGuardian correctly identified exposed Alpaca API credentials in our repository. These keys are currently live in our pushed commits and accessible to anyone who clones the repo.

## EXPOSED CREDENTIALS FOUND

### Alpaca Markets API Keys
**API Key:** `[REDACTED - Keys have been removed]`  
**API Secret:** `[REDACTED - Keys have been removed]`

### Files Containing Exposed Keys

#### Memory Bank (1 file)
- `/memory-bank/debugging-victories/alpaca-integration-success.md` (lines 17-18)
  - Contains both API key and secret in plaintext
  - Part of our knowledge management system

#### Test Files (4 files)
All in sandbox directory:
- `/sandbox/test_alpaca_direct.py` (lines 12-13)
- `/sandbox/test_alpaca_v2.py` 
- `/sandbox/test_alpaca_meme_stocks.py`
- `/sandbox/test_meme_detector_integration.py`

Each file contains hardcoded credentials like:
```python
os.environ['ALPACA_API_KEY'] = 'PKU1N7FUI5SNL5UQ9PCS'
os.environ['ALPACA_API_SECRET'] = 'Y5xtRqY4CSNLgYeIDpSUnBxoLPEYdMFuYiD5PwNJ'
```

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL RISKS
1. **Public Repository Exposure**: These keys are in our GitHub repo history
2. **Paper Trading Account**: While this is a paper account, it still provides:
   - Access to real market data
   - Ability to execute paper trades
   - Potential for abuse/rate limiting our account
3. **Commit History**: Keys exist in commit `43a1044` pushed yesterday

### ðŸŸ¡ MODERATE RISKS
- No other secrets found (AWS, OpenAI, database passwords, etc.)
- Keys are only for Alpaca paper trading, not real money account
- No production database credentials exposed

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### IMMEDIATE (Do First)
1. **Rotate Alpaca Keys**
   - Log into Alpaca dashboard
   - Generate new API key pair
   - Revoke old keys

### CLEANUP (After Rotation)
2. **Remove from Repository**
   - Remove keys from all 5 files
   - Replace with environment variable references
   - Add `.env.example` file with dummy values

3. **Clean Git History** (Nuclear Option)
   - Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
   - Force push to overwrite history
   - All collaborators must re-clone

### PREVENTION
4. **Add Security Measures**
   - Create `.env` file for local development
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
   - Use `python-dotenv` for loading
   - Add pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets

## SAMPLE FIXES

### For Test Files
Replace:
```python
os.environ['ALPACA_API_KEY'] = 'PKU1N7FUI5SNL5UQ9PCS'
```

With:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
# Expects ALPACA_API_KEY in .env file
```

### For Memory Bank
Replace actual keys with:
```markdown
## Working Configuration
Set these in your environment or .env file:
- ALPACA_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
- ALPACA_API_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
```

## FILES REQUIRING MODIFICATION
1. `/memory-bank/debugging-victories/alpaca-integration-success.md`
2. `/sandbox/test_alpaca_direct.py`
3. `/sandbox/test_alpaca_v2.py`
4. `/sandbox/test_alpaca_meme_stocks.py`
5. `/sandbox/test_meme_detector_integration.py`

## GOOD NEWS
- âœ… No database passwords exposed
- âœ… No AWS credentials found
- âœ… No OpenAI or other API keys found
- âœ… No production secrets exposed
- âœ… Main source code properly uses environment variables

## BOTTOM LINE
We have Alpaca paper trading API keys exposed in 5 files. These need to be:
1. Rotated on Alpaca's website
2. Removed from our codebase
3. Replaced with environment variable references

**Awaiting your approval to proceed with cleanup operations.**
