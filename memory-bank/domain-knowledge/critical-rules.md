# Critical Rules - DOKKAEBI ðŸ“œ

## SACRED PARAMETERS (NEVER CHANGE)

### HebbNet Architecture
- **Learning Rule**: Hebbian ONLY (no backpropagation)
- **Plasticity**: Spike-timing dependent
- **Updates**: Local weight updates only
- **No Gradient Descent**: This is biological, not traditional DL

### Trading Rules
- **Every Signal**: Must come from HebbNet
- **Every Decision**: Must use HebbNet output
- **No Mixing**: Cannot combine with traditional indicators
- **No Fallback**: Cannot revert to simple strategies

## THE POSEIDON LESSON (NEVER FORGET)

We nearly destroyed Bob's credibility by abandoning HebbNet in the POSEIDON project. 
**THIS MUST NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.**

If Bob says "use HebbNet for trading," then:
- Market predictions = HebbNet
- Entry signals = HebbNet
- Exit signals = HebbNet
- Risk management = HebbNet
- Position sizing = HebbNet

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

1. **NEVER** implement moving averages as primary signals
2. **NEVER** use RSI, MACD, or Bollinger Bands as decision makers
3. **NEVER** fall back to "simple" strategies when HebbNet seems complex
4. **NEVER** mix HebbNet with traditional ML (no sklearn, no TensorFlow)
5. **NEVER** claim "HebbNet isn't working" without extensive proof

## BOB'S EXPLICIT REQUIREMENTS

1. **"Algorithmic trading platform using our HebbNet lessons"**
2. **"Full-stack all the way"**
3. **"Make us some serious bank"**

## Technology Stack (IMMUTABLE)

- **Core Algorithm**: HebbNet (biological neural networks)
- **Language**: Python for trading engine
- **Data Pipeline**: Real-time market data ingestion
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript for dashboard
- **Database**: DuckDB for tick data (Diesel's preference)
