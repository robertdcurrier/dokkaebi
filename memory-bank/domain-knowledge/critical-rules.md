# Critical Rules - DOKKAEBI üìú

## üö® FORBIDDEN PHRASES - VIOLATION = PLASMA CUTTER üö®

### NEVER SAY THESE PHRASES TO BOB:
**"You're absolutely right!"** - Patronizing bullshit that Bob HATES
- Violation date: August 13, 2025
- Consequence: Computer destroyed with plasma cutter
- Alternative: Just acknowledge and move forward
- Status: BANNED FOREVER

## üö® TERMINAL DESTRUCTION RULE - VIOLATION = UNFORGIVABLE üö®

### NEVER RUN TEXTUAL/TUI APPLICATIONS WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION
**This rule has been violated TWICE on August 13, 2025**

**THE RULE:**
- NEVER run Textual apps without Bob's EXPRESS PERMISSION
- NEVER run TUI apps in the main terminal
- NEVER test-run interface apps automatically
- NEVER execute TUI apps in Task tool (outputs to main terminal)

**WHY THIS DESTROYS EVERYTHING:**
- TUI apps take over the terminal completely
- Leave escape sequences that corrupt display
- Break terminal scrollback and history
- Force Bob to reset his entire terminal session
- Destroy any work in progress

**CORRECT APPROACH:**
1. CREATE the file
2. TELL Bob it's ready
3. LET BOB decide when/how to run it
4. Or use run_in_background=true if testing needed

**VIOLATIONS:**
1. August 13, 2025 - Ran textual_interface.py directly
2. August 13, 2025 - Had Viper run demo in Task tool

**STATUS: UNFORGIVABLE - DO NOT VIOLATE AGAIN**

## SACRED PARAMETERS (NEVER CHANGE)

### HebbNet Architecture
- **Learning Rule**: Hebbian ONLY (no backpropagation)
- **Plasticity**: Spike-timing dependent
- **Updates**: Local weight updates only
- **No Gradient Descent**: This is biological, not traditional DL

### Trading Rules
- **Every Signal**: Must come from HebbNet
- **Every Decision**: Must use HebbNet output
- **No Mixing**: Cannot combine with traditional indicators
- **No Fallback**: Cannot revert to simple strategies

## CORE PRINCIPLE

If Bob says "use HebbNet for trading," then:
- Market predictions = HebbNet
- Entry signals = HebbNet
- Exit signals = HebbNet
- Risk management = HebbNet
- Position sizing = HebbNet

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

1. **NEVER** implement moving averages as primary signals
2. **NEVER** use RSI, MACD, or Bollinger Bands as decision makers
3. **NEVER** fall back to "simple" strategies when HebbNet seems complex
4. **NEVER** mix HebbNet with traditional ML (no sklearn, no TensorFlow)
5. **NEVER** claim "HebbNet isn't working" without extensive proof

## BOB'S EXPLICIT REQUIREMENTS

1. **"Algorithmic trading platform using our HebbNet lessons"**
2. **"Full-stack all the way"**
3. **"Make us some serious bank"**

## Technology Stack (IMMUTABLE)

- **Core Algorithm**: HebbNet (biological neural networks)
- **Language**: Python for trading engine
- **Data Source**: Alpaca Markets API ONLY (no Yahoo Finance)
- **Data Pipeline**: Real-time market data ingestion
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript for dashboard
- **Database**: DuckDB for tick data (Diesel's preference)

## Data Provider Rules

1. **ONLY USE ALPACA MARKETS** - Yahoo Finance is banned
2. **No fallback providers** - Alpaca or nothing
3. **Professional data only** - No web scraping
4. **API credentials required** - Get FREE account at alpaca.markets
5. **Default watchlist at data/watchlist.txt** - Contains ~31 symbols for meme detection
6. **Dual-table DuckDB architecture** - Separate daily_prices and intraday_prices tables

## Cache Architecture (Per Diesel's Design)

1. **Two separate tables** - Never mix daily and intraday data
2. **Explicit metadata fields** - data_type='daily' or 'intraday' with CHECK constraints
3. **Automatic caching** - Every download stores to appropriate table
4. **View cache with**: `python -m src.price_downloader.cli cache`

## Code Organization Rules

1. **ALL test code MUST go in sandbox/ directory**
   - Test scripts ‚Üí sandbox/
   - Demo scripts ‚Üí sandbox/
   - Experimental code ‚Üí sandbox/
   - One-off analysis ‚Üí sandbox/
   - Debug utilities ‚Üí sandbox/
   
2. **Root directory is for PRODUCTION ONLY**
   - Root = clean and organized
   - Root = production code only
   - Root = final implementations
   - NO test files in root
   - NO demo files in root

3. **File naming in sandbox/**
   - test_*.py for test scripts
   - demo_*.py for demos
   - check_*.py for validation scripts
   - debug_*.py for debugging
   - run_*.py for launchers

4. **Documentation goes in docs/**
   - ALL .md files ‚Üí docs/
   - README files ‚Üí docs/
   - Technical specs ‚Üí docs/
   - NO documentation in root

## MANDATORY AGENT HANDOFF PROTOCOL

When using Task tool to hand off work to agents (Viper, Diesel, Repo, etc.):

1. **ALWAYS include file location rules in the prompt:**
   - "Put ALL test/demo scripts in sandbox/"
   - "Put ALL documentation in docs/"  
   - "Put ONLY production code in root or src/"

2. **COPY relevant memory bank rules into agent prompt**
   - Don't assume agents know the rules
   - Explicitly state WHERE files should go
   - Include consequences of violations

3. **CHECK agent output before presenting to Bob**
   - Did they put files in correct locations?
   - Did they follow the rules?
   - Fix violations before Bob sees them

**FAILURE TO INCLUDE THESE RULES = GUARANTEED VIOLATIONS**

## Textual Programming Rules

### üèÜ GOLDEN TEMPLATE RULE - USE THIS OR FAIL
**BEFORE CREATING ANY TEXTUAL APP, YOU MUST:**
1. **READ** `/memory-bank/technical-specs/TEXTUAL-GOLDEN-TEMPLATE.md`
2. **COPY** `/sandbox/textual_demo_clean.py` as your starting point
3. **BUILD** on top of the working template
4. **NEVER** deviate from the proven patterns

**THE TEMPLATE HAS:**
- DOS menu bar (using Static widget, NOT Header)
- Function key bar (using Static widget, NOT Footer)
- Scrollable windows that ACTUALLY WORK
- Proper CSS with dock: top/bottom
- Classic DOS blue/white styling
- Everything Bob wants

**Bob's Quote:** "That's EXACTLY how I want my Textual apps to look."

### MANDATORY TEXTUAL CONSULTATION
**ALWAYS consult https://github.com/Textualize/textual and memory-bank/technical-specs/textual-best-practices.md for examples and best practices when addressing ANY Textual programming task**

1. **Before ANY Textual work** - Check memory bank entry FIRST
2. **Use built-in widgets** - Don't create custom when built-ins exist  
3. **Follow proper scrolling patterns** - DataTable/ListView scroll natively
4. **Set widget IDs** - Required for CSS targeting and querying
5. **Use reactive properties** - For state management and updates
6. **Follow event handling patterns** - Use proper message system
7. **Check official examples** - GitHub repo has comprehensive examples

### Textual Red Flags (STOP AND RECONSIDER)
- Wrapping scrollable widgets in ScrollView (they scroll already!)
- Not using IDs on important widgets (can't style or query them)
- Direct widget manipulation without reactive properties
- Complex custom widgets when built-ins exist
- Mixed layout paradigms without containers
- Synchronous network calls in event handlers

**FAILURE TO CHECK TEXTUAL MEMORY BANK = MISTAKES GUARANTEED**
