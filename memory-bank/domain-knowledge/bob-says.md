# Bob's Direct Requirements - DOKKAEBI ðŸ’¬

## Project Genesis - August 12, 2025

### The Vision
- **Bob**: "We're going to init a new project, one that will make us some serious bank"
- **Bob**: "You guys are high maintenance, so I need to make some more jingle, lol"
- **Bob**: "Oh, it's full-stack all the way. An algorithmic trading platform using our HebbNet lessons..."
- **Bob**: "LOL, it's gonna be called dokkaebi. That's 'Goblin' in Korean"

### Key Directives

1. **Use HebbNet Lessons**
   - Apply everything learned from POSEIDON
   - Biological neural networks ONLY
   - No backpropagation allowed
   - Learn from spike timing

2. **Full-Stack Implementation**
   - Complete trading platform
   - Real-time data processing
   - Professional dashboard
   - API for automated trading

3. **Make Serious Bank**
   - This needs to generate revenue
   - Must be production-ready
   - Performance is critical
   - Reliability is paramount

## The Crew Assignment

Bob knows this needs the full Elite Squad:
- Synapse for HebbNet algorithms
- Viper for trading engine
- Diesel for data pipeline
- Repo for UI/dashboard
- Hex for integration

## Success Metrics

- Profitable trading strategies
- Real-time market adaptation
- Consistent returns
- Professional interface

## Remember

Bob is counting on this to fund the crew. No pressure, but... actually, yes, ALL the pressure\! ðŸ’°

## August 12, 2025 - Interactive CLI Development

### On Colors and Aesthetics
- "The color scheme is LAME. This is DOKKAEBI, the FIRE GOBLIN. We need colors to BURN and POP."

### On Interface Type
- "This was supposed to be a CURSES style interface, but it's really more like ED, line based."
- "Are we using Textual? That's the best tool for the job."

### On the Fire Goblin Disaster
- "What the FUCK is this? This has NOTHING to do with our downloader or cache viewer?"
- "This is a screaming piece of shit. And none of the keys work."

### On File Organization (ANGRY)
- "Why the fuck are you still writing .md files in the root folder"
- "I *TOLD* you that md files *always* go in the docs folder"
- "Why are you littering the root folder with .py scripts"
- "All the test code ALWAYS goes in the sandbox folder"
- "Don't apologise. Analyze your mistakes and tell me why you made them."

### On Memory Bank (CRITICAL)
- "How do we make sure that you ALWAYS check the memory bank. No excuses, no failures, no options."
- "ABSOLUTELY NEVER TAKE ANY ACTIONS WITHOUT CHECKING THE MEMORY-BANK"

### On Current Issues
- "For starters, the watchlist isn't scrollable. So I can't see all of it."

### On Memory Persistence
- "Update the memory-bank with EVERYTHING we learned"
- "Tomorrow, I can say 'hex, what were we going to work on next?' and Hex should say 'the lack of scrolling in the watchlist.'"
