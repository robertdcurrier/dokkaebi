# Alpaca Markets Integration Victory

## Date: August 12, 2025

## Problem Solved
Yahoo Finance rate limiting was blocking our data downloads. IEX Cloud shutting down. Needed reliable data source.

## Solution
Successfully integrated Alpaca Markets as primary data provider:
- FREE paper trading account
- 200+ API calls/minute (no rate limiting!)
- Professional-grade market data
- 250+ days of historical data per request

## Working Configuration
```bash
# Set these environment variables (get keys from https://alpaca.markets)
export ALPACA_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
export ALPACA_API_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
```

## CLI Commands
```bash
# Download with Alpaca (default)
python src/price_downloader/cli.py download-v2 GME AMC DNUT

# Explicitly specify provider
python src/price_downloader/cli.py download-v2 AAPL MSFT --provider alpaca

# Fall back to Yahoo if needed
python src/price_downloader/cli.py download-v2 AAPL --provider yahoo
```

## Files Created
- `/src/price_downloader/providers/alpaca_provider.py` - AlpacaProvider class
- `/docs/ALPACA_SETUP.md` - Setup documentation (moved from root)

## Lessons Learned
1. Always have backup data providers
2. FREE doesn't mean unreliable (Alpaca > Yahoo)
3. Professional APIs worth the setup time
4. Documentation should go in docs/ or memory-bank, not root directory
