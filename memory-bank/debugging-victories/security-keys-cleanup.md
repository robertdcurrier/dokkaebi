# Security Victory - API Keys Cleanup

## Date: August 13, 2025

## Problem
GitGuardian flagged exposed Alpaca API keys in our repository. Keys were hardcoded in:
- 1 memory bank file
- 4 test files in sandbox/

## Solution
Successfully scrubbed all API keys from codebase:

### Files Cleaned
1. `/memory-bank/debugging-victories/alpaca-integration-success.md` - Replaced with placeholder text
2. `/sandbox/test_alpaca_direct.py` - Now loads from environment
3. `/sandbox/test_alpaca_v2.py` - Now loads from environment
4. `/sandbox/test_alpaca_meme_stocks.py` - Now loads from environment
5. `/sandbox/test_meme_detector_integration.py` - Now loads from environment

### Security Improvements Added
- Created `.env.example` with template for credentials
- Added setup instructions to README
- Security audit report saved to `docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`

## Key Learning
Even in private repos, NEVER commit API keys! Always use:
- Environment variables
- .env files (in .gitignore)
- Proper credential management

## Commit Reference
- Commit: `dead0d5` (perfect hash for killing secrets!)
- Message: "security: Remove exposed API keys from codebase üîê"

## Status
‚úÖ RESOLVED - GitGuardian issue fixed
‚úÖ Repository clean of secrets
‚úÖ Best practices now in place
