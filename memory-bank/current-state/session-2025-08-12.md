# Session Log - August 12, 2025

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. DuckDB Cache Integration Complete ‚úÖ
- Integrated PriceCacheV2 with AlpacaProvider
- Data now automatically stores to DuckDB on every download
- Dual-table architecture working:
  - `daily_prices` table: 31 symbols, 7,640 rows
  - `intraday_prices` table: 30 symbols, 213,144 rows
- Both tables have explicit `data_type` metadata fields for safety
- Cache viewer command: `python -m src.price_downloader.cli cache`

### 2. Root Directory Cleanup ‚úÖ
- Moved all test files to sandbox/
- Moved all documentation to docs/
- Root is now clean (production only)
- Files moved:
  - `test_simple.py` ‚Üí `sandbox/`
  - `demo_scanner.py` ‚Üí `sandbox/`
  - `main.py` ‚Üí `sandbox/old_main.py`
  - `config.py` ‚Üí `sandbox/old_config.py`

### 3. Interactive CLI Development Journey üî•

#### First Attempt: Rich-based scrolling interface (FAILED)
- Built by Viper and Repo
- Problem: Just scrolling text, not a real TUI
- Colors were "LAME" - not fire goblin enough

#### Second Attempt: Curses interface (FAILED)
- Proper full-screen interface
- Fire goblin colors (burning orange, molten gold)
- Problem: `addwstr() returned ERR` - Unicode emojis broke it
- Curses can't handle modern Unicode properly

#### Third Attempt: Textual "Fire Goblin" (WRONG DIRECTION)
- Built elaborate fire goblin trading dashboard
- Problem: "screaming piece of shit" - completely disconnected from our actual system
- Had fake demo data instead of using our real AlpacaProvider and cache

#### Fourth Attempt: REAL Textual Interface (SUCCESS... mostly)
- `src/price_downloader/textual_interface.py` - Production code
- Actually integrates with:
  - AlpacaProvider for real downloads
  - PriceCacheV2 for real cache operations
  - data/watchlist.txt for real symbols
  - data/price_cache.duckdb with 220K+ rows
- Three functional tabs:
  - Download: Select interval, download watchlist or custom symbols
  - Cache Viewer: Shows actual cache statistics
  - Watchlist Manager: Edit the real watchlist file
- Launcher: `sandbox/test_textual_interface.py`

## Critical Issues Discovered

### 1. MEMORY BANK ENFORCEMENT FAILURE üö®
- Multiple violations of file placement rules
- Agents (Viper, Repo) created files in wrong locations
- Root cause: Memory bank rules weren't being included in agent prompts

### 2. Download Command Behavior
- Each interval requires separate download command
- `download` (default) ‚Üí daily data only
- `download --interval 5Min` ‚Üí 5-minute data only
- This is EXPECTED behavior, not a bug
- That's why we had 31 symbols in daily but only 1 in intraday initially

## MANDATORY RULES ESTABLISHED

### 1. ABSOLUTE MEMORY BANK RULE (Added to CLAUDE.md)
**"NEVER TAKE ANY ACTIONS WITHOUT CHECKING THE MEMORY-BANK FIRST"**
- If no memory-bank exists: STOP and report to Bob
- Check memory-bank before EVERY action
- No exceptions

### 2. MANDATORY AGENT HANDOFF PROTOCOL
When using Task tool with agents:
1. ALWAYS include file location rules in prompt:
   - "Put ALL test/demo scripts in sandbox/"
   - "Put ALL documentation in docs/"
   - "Put ONLY production code in root or src/"
2. Copy relevant memory bank rules INTO agent prompt
3. Check agent output before presenting to Bob

### 3. File Organization Rules (ENFORCED)
- Test/demo code ‚Üí sandbox/
- Documentation ‚Üí docs/
- Production only ‚Üí root or src/
- NO EXCEPTIONS

## Outstanding Issues to Fix

### 1. Watchlist Not Scrollable üî¥
**Bob's exact words:** "For starters, the watchlist isn't scrollable. So I can't see all of it."
- Current Textual interface shows watchlist but doesn't scroll
- Need to implement scrollable container for watchlist display
- This is the NEXT PRIORITY TASK

### 2. Textual Interface Improvements Needed
- Watchlist scrolling (PRIORITY)
- Better progress indicators during downloads
- Error handling for failed symbols
- Refresh button for cache statistics
- Ability to download specific symbols from watchlist

## Technical Decisions & Lessons

### 1. Textual vs Curses
- Curses is ancient and can't handle Unicode
- Textual is modern, handles Unicode, has proper widgets
- Decision: Use Textual for all TUI needs going forward

### 2. Import Path Issues
- Direct execution fails with relative imports
- Solution: Always create launcher scripts in sandbox/
- Launchers add parent to sys.path properly

### 3. DuckDB Cache Design (Diesel's Architecture)
- Two separate tables is the RIGHT approach
- Explicit metadata fields prevent confusion
- Indexes on (symbol, date) for performance
- Cache file at 38.76 MB with 220K+ rows performing well

## Bob's Feedback Patterns

### What Makes Bob Angry üò†
- Files in wrong locations (root pollution)
- Fake demo data instead of real integration
- Not following established rules
- "Lame" colors that don't "burn and pop"
- Interfaces that are "screaming pieces of shit"

### What Bob Wants üí∞
- Real integration with existing systems
- Fire goblin aesthetic (burning colors)
- Clean root directory
- Memory bank compliance
- Functional software, not demos

## Commands to Remember

```bash
# Download daily data (default)
python -m src.price_downloader.cli download

# Download intraday data
python -m src.price_downloader.cli download --interval 5Min

# View cache statistics
python -m src.price_downloader.cli cache

# Run Textual interface
python sandbox/test_textual_interface.py

# Direct module execution
python -m src.price_downloader.textual_interface
```

## Next Session Priority

**IMMEDIATE TASK: Fix watchlist scrolling in Textual interface**
- Bob specifically mentioned this issue
- Watchlist display needs scrollable container
- File: src/price_downloader/textual_interface.py
- Test with: sandbox/test_textual_interface.py

## Session End State
- Price downloader: WORKING ‚úÖ
- DuckDB cache: WORKING ‚úÖ
- Textual interface: MOSTLY WORKING ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Memory bank protocol: ENFORCED ‚úÖ
- File organization: CLEAN ‚úÖ
- Next task: FIX SCROLLING üî¥
