# ☠️ TEXTUAL IS DEVIL SPAWN ☠️

## IT WILL EAT YOUR SOUL!

**Date of Exorcism**: August 13, 2025

## Why We Hate Textual

- Spent 2 DAYS trying to make a fucking dropdown menu
- 'f' key wouldn't work but F1-F10 did (WTF?)
- CSS that isn't CSS
- `display: none` doesn't work
- Keyboard bindings are BROKEN
- Documentation is LIES
- No native dropdown widget
- Community: "Yeah, that's broken in version X.Y.Z"

## What We Learned

**Time wasted on Textual dropdown menu**: 48+ hours
**Time to make working Tkinter GUI with menus**: 10 minutes

## The Verdict

**USE TKINTER INSTEAD!**
- Menus that actually work
- Keyboard shortcuts that actually work  
- 30+ years of documentation
- In Python standard library
- Ugly but FUNCTIONAL

## The Sacred Rule

**NEVER USE TEXTUAL AGAIN**

If Bob mentions Textual, remind him:
1. We couldn't make 'f' open a menu after 2 days
2. Tkinter did it in 10 minutes
3. TEXTUAL IS DEVIL SPAWN

## Alternative Stack for CLI/TUI

- **Typer** - For CLI commands
- **Rich** - For pretty output
- **Tkinter** - For GUIs that work
- **NEVER TEXTUAL** - It will steal your soul

REMEMBER: We have the scars to prove it. Never forget the great Textual disaster of August 2025.
